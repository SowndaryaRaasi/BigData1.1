            It divides data set and distributes data among multiple servers.

4.Need and Working ofHadoop
   Need:
       Hadoop provides the best framework to deal with the challenges of bigdata which cannot be solved using traditional 
       systems. 
   Working:
       Hadoop consists of 2 components: 1.HDFS:Used to store data.
                                        2.Map Reduce: Used for processing that data.
